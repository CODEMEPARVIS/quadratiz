            <h2>About Quadratic Equation</h2>
            <p>Quadratics can be defined as a polynomial equation of a second degree, which implies that it comprises a minimum of one term that is squared. It is also called quadratic equations. The general form of the quadratic equation is:</p>
            <p><b>ax² + bx + c = 0</b></p>
            <p>where x is an unknown variable and a, b, c are numerical coefficients. For example, x2 + 2x +1 is a quadratic or quadratic equation. Here, a ≠ 0 because if it equals zero then the equation will not remain quadratic anymore and it will become a linear equation, such as: </p>
            <p>bx+c=0</p>
            <p>Thus, this equation cannot be called a quadratic equation.</p>
            <p>The terms a, b and c are also called quadratic coefficients. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The solutions to the quadratic equation are the values of the unknown variable x, which satisfy the equation. These solutions are called roots or zeros of quadratic equations. The roots of any polynomial are the solutions for the given equation.</p>

        <h2>Quadratics Formula</h2>
        <p>The formula for a quadratic equation is used to find the roots of the equation. Since quadratics have a degree equal to two, therefore there will be two solutions for the equation. Suppose ax² + bx + c = 0 is the quadratic equation, then the formula to find the roots of this equation will be:</p>
        <p><b>x = [-b±√(b2-4ac)]/2a</b></p>
        <p>The sign of plus/minus indicates there will be two solutions for x. Learn in detail the quadratic formula here.</p>
